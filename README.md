# Chatbot with Deep Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the **Chatbot with Deep Learning** project! This repository contains the code and resources to build an intelligent chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) and neural network models to understand and respond to user queries in a human-like manner.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes and comprehends user inputs using NLP techniques.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Utilizes deep learning models such as LSTM or Transformer for generating responses.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains context during a conversation for coherent interactions.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Easily extendable to include more intents and responses.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-with-deep-learning.git
    cd chatbot-with-deep-learning
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**:
    - Prepare your dataset in the `data/` directory.
    - Run the training script:
      ```bash
      python train.py
      ```

2. **Running the Chatbot**:
    - Start the chatbot:
      ```bash
      python chatbot.py
      ```
    - Interact with the chatbot through the command line interface or integrate it with a messaging platform.
